## The Aim Of The Project
Develop an app with new technologies and best practices in android development such as:
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.<br>&nbsp;<br>
- [Clean Architecture](https://medium.com/android-dev-hacks/detailed-guide-on-android-clean-architecture-9eab262a9011)  - Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the elements of a design into ring levels.<br>&nbsp;<br>
- [SOLID](https://medium.com/the-android-caf%C3%A9/solid-principles-the-kotlin-way-ff717c0d60da)  - SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.<br>&nbsp;<br>
- [CICD](https://resources.github.com/ci-cd/)  - CI-CD comprises of continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment. Put together, they form a CI-CD pipeline, a series of automated workflows that help DevOps teams cut down on manual tasks.<br>&nbsp;<br>
- [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)  - Its principal advantage is that it caches state and persists it through configuration changes.<br>&nbsp;<br>
- [HILT](https://dagger.dev/hilt)  - Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.<br>&nbsp;<br>
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)  - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. Retrofit turns your HTTP API into a Java interface.<br>&nbsp;<br>
- [Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)  - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.<br>&nbsp;<br>
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)  - In addition to opening the doors to asynchronous programming, coroutines also provide a wealth of other possibilities, such as concurrency and actors.<br>&nbsp;<br>
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.<br>&nbsp;<br>
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
